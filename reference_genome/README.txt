Download the latest reference genome sequence and associated annotation for your species from the Ensembl ftp site. For the sequence, use the file named species.assembly.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz (under DNA(FASTA)). For the annotation, I suggest you use the gtf (under gene sets) named species.assembly.build.gtf.gz. Make sure you check that the downloaded files are intact by computing checksums sum <yourfile> and comparing them to the values in the CHECKSUMS file on the ftp server.
